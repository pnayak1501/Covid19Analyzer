# Covid19Analyzer
Covid19 Analyzer built using Java

# Abstract
Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). The disease has taken the world by shock and has led to many countries put their respective countries into lockdown to avoid the spread of the same. <br />
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new strain that was discovered in 2019 and has not been previously identified in humans.
Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. <br />
Our idea is to analyze the situation of the country, by taking the input of number of cases weekly(as there is no API to do the same) and give a report at the end of the 8th week and suggest some precautionary measures to tackle the same.

# Problem Statement
In the present context Corona Virus poses high threat to human lives, economy of any country. Its been observed from many researches that an eight-week data of number of cases is required to analyze the situation of any country. So our idea is to analyze the situation of any country, by taking the input of number of cases weekly(as there is no API to do the same) and to give a report at the end of the 8th week and suggest some precautionary measures to tackle the same.

# Introduction
JFreeChart is open source and 100% free, which permits usage in the commercial applications without any cost. We have enlisted here some more points in favor of why you should use JFreeChart − <br />
●	It comes with well documented APIs, which makes it quite easy to understand. <br />
●	It supports a wide range of chart types such as Pie Chart, Line Chart, Bar Chart, Area Chart and 3D charts. <br />
●	JFreeChart is easy to extend and can be used in both, the client-side, as well as the server-side applications. <br />
●	It supports multiple output formats like PNG, JPEG, PDF, SVG etc. <br />
●	It allows extensive customizations of charts. <br />
Consider a situation where you are developing an application and you need to show the data in the form of charts, and the data itself is populated dynamically. In such a case, displaying the data in the form of charts using JFreeChart programming is very simple.

# Overview of the Project
Our project is used as visual representation for present day deaths caused due to COVID-19 attack. We used JfreeChart (java library)to draw bar graph by taking input of weekly deaths from user using Graphical User Interface. <br />
We also made an effort to analysis the effect of pandemic situation on deaths by calculating slopes . we prompted messages saying at which week was highest deaths and also calculated rate of spread of virus.The bar graph helps us analysis state of pandemic situation, if it is improving or worsening. <br />
Overall we tried to blend java swings and java graphs concepts to complete the project .  <br /> 

# Tools used
●	Java Swings - Swing is a GUI widget toolkit for Java. It is part of Oracle's Java Foundation Classes – an API for providing a graphical user interface for Java programs. <br />
●	Netbeans IDE - NetBeans is an integrated development environment for Java. NetBeans allows applications to be developed from a set of modular software components called modules <br />
●	Java JDK <br />
●	jFreeChart - JFreeChart is an open-source framework for the programming language Java, which allows the creation of a wide variety of both interactive and non-interactive charts. <br />
